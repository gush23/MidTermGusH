<script>The basketball team was the catalyst for the athletics program and formed it’s first team in 2009, competing in adult leagues in the city.  Now it boasts a full schedule against collegiate teams from November – March which culminates with the Northeast Art School Basketball Invitational (NASBI).  The basketball team plays against men’s teams, but accepts female participation.</script>
<script>In Fall 2014 we began a men’s and women’s tennis team and they took off.  This season we are looking for talented tennis players who want to continue competition through college.  The team practices M/W/F, 7:30-10am at East River Park and competes mostly at the USTA National Tennis Center.</script> == $0
